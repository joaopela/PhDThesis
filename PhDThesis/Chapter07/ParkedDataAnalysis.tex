The search for Higgs boson invisible decays has already been attempted in past experiments and is also the topic of many \gls{LHC} analyses. Searches were performed by the \gls{LEP} experiments \cite{ARTICLE:LEPSearchesForInvisibleHiggsBosons,ARTICLE:LEPDELPHISearchesForInvisibleDecayingHiggsBosons,ARTICLE:LEPOPALSearchForInvisiblyDecayingHiggsBosons} and at the \gls{LHC} with the full 7 and $8\,\TeV$ datasets, by the \gls{ATLAS} collaboration \cite{ARTICLE:ATLASSearchForInvisibleDecaysHiggsBosonAssociatedZ,ARTICLE:ATLASSearchForDarkMatterWithHadronicallyWorZ,ARTICLE:ATLASMonoJetPlusMET,ARTICLE:ATLASVBFHiggsInvConfNote} and by the \gls{CMS} collaboration \cite{ARTICLE:CMSVBFHiggsToInvAndZHCombination} where the most sensitive analysis was presented at chapter \ref{CHAPTER:PromptDataAnalysis}. With the assumption of the \gls{SM} production cross section and acceptance for the Higgs boson and using the \gls{VBF} production mode, the \gls{ATLAS} collaboration has placed a preliminary observed (expected) upper limit on the Higgs boson branching fraction to Invisible, \BRinv, of 0.29 (0.35) at 95\% confidence level for $m_H=125.5\,\GeV$ \cite{ARTICLE:ATLASVBFHiggsInvConfNote}. The \gls{CMS} collaboration had combined both the \gls{VBF} and ZH production modes to set an observed (expected) upper limit on the \BRinv at  $m_H=125\,\GeV$ of 0.58\,(0.44) at 95\% confidence level \cite{ARTICLE:CMSVBFHiggsToInvAndZHCombination}.

This chapter describes the analysis performed over the \gls{CMS} Run I proton-proton parked data collected over 2012. A total integrated luminosity of $19.2 \pm 0.5$ was analysed. This data was recorded and stored without reconstruction and only became fully available a few months after data taking during the \gls{LS1}. The advantage of this approach was the possibility of using lower threshold triggers which can collect more signal but unfortunately also more backgrounds. To take full advantage of this data the analysis had to be redesigned and extended with new control regions. To validate the obtained results a new cross check analysis was also preformed.

\section{The Cross Check Analysis}
\label{CHAPTER:ParkedDataAnalysis_CrossCheckAnalysis}

%Status: DONE

It is normally a requirement for many \gls{CMS} publications to have a cross check analysis implemented independently from the main result in order to be able to ensure the accuracy of the final results due to possible errors with the software implementation. For this purpose the \gls{CMS} \gls{VBF} Higgs to invisible result using prompt data presented in chapter \ref{CHAPTER:PromptDataAnalysis}, was produced by two different and independent code frameworks. Before publication a good level of synchronization was obtained validating the obtained measurement. Due to lack of man power and time it was decide for the 2012-13 parked data analysis to only proceed with a single framework. At a later stage of the analysis it was thought that at least some level of cross check would be a good measure to limit the possibility of implementation errors and to allow extra confidence on the final results.
 
This cross check analysis starts from the physics object files, \textit{ntuples}, produced by the main analysis for all the relevant datasets. The software used for this object extraction process and its data formats are also used by other analyses at Imperial College London, including both the \gls{SM}, and \gls{MSSM} Higgs to $\tau\bar{\tau}$, the Higgs to $\tau\bar{\tau}b\bar{b}$ and prompt Higgs to invisible analyses. These analysis have been cross checked independently and therefore the part of the software is considered to be sufficiently validated. No event requirements are applied at this physics object production level except the official \gls{CMS} list of certified good luminosity sections for physics usage.
 
The analysis of these \textit{ntuples} was performed by an independent code framework which was developed in order to replicate all relevant event yields produced by the main analysis for data. Due to time constraints to the planned unbinding of the analysis, only the yields in data were cross checked.

\subsection{Data}

%Status: DONE

This analysis used the full  $\sqrt{s}=8\,\TeV$ Run I proton-proton certified collision data. The total integrated luminosity analysed is $19.2 \pm 0.5 \,\femto\barn^{-1}$ \cite{ARTICLE:CMSLuminosityBasedonPixelClusterCounting}. The \gls{LHC} Run I was composed of four periods A, B, C and D which identify major changes on either the \gls{LHC} or \gls{CMS}, like de deployment of new reconstruction software.

The triggers used in this analysis, selected events with two jets with the distinct \gls{VBF} topology and \gls{MET}. Three trigger were used during 2012 depending on the data taking period. All selected trigger paths are seeded by the same \gls{L1T} condition which required then event to have \gls{L1T} \gls{MET}$>40\,\GeV$, the quantity us calculated using the calorimeter trigger towers up to $|\eta|<3.0$. The trigger used during Run A is the same as the one used in the \textit{prompt analysis} already presented in chapter \ref{CHAPTER:PromptDataAnalysis}, and selects events with one pair of \gls{PF} jets with $\pt>40\,\GeV$, $M_{jj}>800\,\GeV$, and $\Delta\eta_{jj}>3.5$ and \gls{PF} $MET_{no-\mu}>65\,\GeV$. The trigger used in Run B and C (D) are the new parked triggers which select events with at least one pair of calorimeter jets with $\pt>35(30)\,\GeV$, $M_{jj}>700\,\GeV$ and $\Delta\eta>3.5$. A summary of the integrated luminosity used according the each data taking period and provenance can be found in table \ref{TABLE:ParkedData_Data_RunI_IntegratedLuminosity}.

\input{Chapter07/Tables/table_Data_RunI_IntegratedLuminosity.tex}

The \gls{VBF} Higgs inclusive parked trigger only became available in the beginning of the 2012 Run B. Similarly to the \textit{prompt analysis}, for Run A the prompt data recorded by the dedicated \gls{VBF} Higgs to invisible trigger is used. The difference between the certified and analysed numbers is due to the new \gls{VBF} Higgs inclusive parked trigger being present but not active for the first few runs of the 2012 Run B.

\subsection{Monte Carlo Samples}

%Status: DONE

A variety of event generator were used to simulate the background of this analysis. The \gls{VBF} Higgs to invisible signal was simulated using the \textsc{POWHEG} 2 event generator \cite{ARTICLE:POWHEG_2004,ARTICLE:POWHEG_2007,ARTICLE:POWHEG_2009v1,ARTICLE:POWHEG_2009v2,ARTICLE:POWHEG_2010v1,ARTICLE:POWHEG_2010v2,ARTICLE:POWHEG_2011v1,ARTICLE:POWHEG_2011v2} and its hadronization was performed with \textsc{PYTHIA} 6.4.26 \cite{ARTICLE:Pythia6p4PhysicsAndManual}. The main backgrounds arising from W and Z decays associated with jets (W/Z+jets) and $t\bar{t}$ also with associated additional jets are simulated using \textsc{MADGRAPH} 5.1.1 \cite{ARTICLE:MadGraph5,ARTICLE:aMCatNLO} hadronization is also done using \textsc{PYTHIA}. Additional samples are produced for \gls{EWK} Z and W processes. Table \ref{TABLE:ParkedDataAnalysis_MCSamples_Summary} shows the cross sections for the used samples and their equivalent integrated luminosity.

%Status: DONE

To compare \gls{MC} with data the simulation must re-weights to match observed key distribution. Simulated events are individually reweighed by  to match data \gls{PU} distribution, probability of passing the trigger, lepton identification probability.

%Status: DONE

The distribution of \gls{PU} in data and \gls{MC} simulated events samples is not the same. Each \gls{MC} dataset is re weighted event by event in order to match the observed distribution in the analysed data. The average \gls{PU} is estimated to be os 21 simultaneous interactions per bunch crossing.

\subsection{Trigger efficiency}
\label{SUBSECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_CorrectionFactors_TriggerEfficiency}

%Status: DONE

The initial event selection for data in this analysis starts with a dedicated set of triggers. During Run A the same trigger used in the \textit{prompt analysis} while for runs B, C and D new parked data triggers are used. To maximize the usage of the event statistics of the selected \gls{MC} samples, we do not veto events that fail the trigger conditions. Instead an event by event weight is calculated which takes into account how much luminosity was recorded by each one of the individual triggers. The applies weight depends on offline quantities corresponding to the ones used in the trigger conditions: \gls{PF} $MET_{no-\mu}$, leading dijet $m_{jj}$ and sub-leading jet \pt. 

To determined the weights, turn on curves were obtained according to these offline variables as a function of \gls{PF} $MET_{no-\mu}$ in bins of dijet $m_{jj}$ and sub-leading jet \pt using independent events recorded by a single-muon trigger. This approach allows the determination of the weights which include the correlations between these variables. The turn on curves are obtained by fitting equation \ref{EQUATION:ParkedDataAnalysis_TriggerEfficiency_Efficiency} to each bin.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\varepsilon_{max}}{2}\text{Erf}\left(\frac{x-x_{0}}{\sqrt{\Gamma}}\right)+1,
\label{EQUATION:ParkedDataAnalysis_TriggerEfficiency_Efficiency} 
\end{equation}

Where $\varepsilon_{max}$ os the maximum efficiency of the trigger in the bin, $x_{0}$ is the mid-value of the turn on and $\Gamma$ is the width of the turn on.

\subsection{Lepton Identification}

%Status: DONE

The used lepton identification criteria follows \gls{CMS} Electron-Gamma and Moun \gls{POG} recommendations. The same \gls{POG} have measured the efficiency of identifying for each lepton criteria as a function of \pt and $\eta$. When selecting leptons the events are reweighed using scale factors per lepton. When vetoing events in the presence of leptons, veto efficiencies are applied per lepton identified at generator level passing the acceptance requirements of electrons (muons) of $\pt>10\,\GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.4(2.1)$.

\section{Signal event selection}
\label{SECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_SignalEventSelection}

%Status: DONE

Most of the events recorded by the triggers are origin in \gls{QCD} multi-jet processes. For this type of events the \gls{MET} requirement is fulfilled in two different ways, events with miss measured jets creating \textit{fake} \gls{MET} and event with genuine \gls{MET} involving neutrinos coming particularly heavy-flavour decays. The introduction of a \gls{MET} significance, $\text{MET}_{sig}$, hard requirement reduces the contribution from \textit{fake} \gls{MET} events significantly. Both types of of \gls{QCD} multi-jet events can be suppressed by requiring that the all jets above $\pt>30\,\GeV$ are separated by a minimum azimuthal angle to the \gls{MET} vector, $\Delta\phi(\text{MET},jets)$.

The trigger requirements and the need to reduce the contribution to a negligible level drive the choice of the following base criteria. Events are selected where the leading pair of particle flow anti-$k_T^{\Delta R=0.5}$ jets have $\eta_{j1} \cdot \eta_{j2}<0$, $\pt^{jet_1},\pt^{jet_2} > 50,40\,\GeV$, $|\eta_{jets}| < 4.7$, $\Delta\eta_{jj}>3.6$, $M_{jj}>1000\,\GeV$.  Where $jet_1$ and $jet_2$ are respectively the leading and sub-leading jets in decreasing \pt order of the event. Missing transverse energy is required to be at least $90\,\GeV$, $\text{MET}_{sig}>4.0$ and $\Delta\phi(\text{MET},jets)>2.0$. Additionally, events are vetoed if an veto electron or a loose muon are found with identification criteria defined in chapter \ref{CHAPTER:EventReconstructionAndSimulation}.

The events selected by this criteria are in order of decreasing predicted yield, W($\ell\nu$) and Z($\nu\nu$) + jets, QCD multi-jet processes, $t\bar{t}$ and single top, dibosons and Drell--Yan$(\ell\ell)\text{+jets}$. The selection is optimised by tightening the proposed requirements in order to obtain the best 95\% C.L. expected limit on \BRinv for a $m_H=125\,\GeV$ Higgs boson. The optimal selection, which is defined as the signal region, is found to be the presented base criteria with the additional tighter requirements of $\Delta\phi(\text{MET},jets)>2.3$, $\pt^{jet_2}>45\,\GeV$ and $M_{jj}>1200\,\GeV$. Table \ref{TABLE:ParkedDataAnalysis_SignalEventSelection_CrossSectionYields} shows the obtained yield for each step of the event selection obtained by the cross check analysis.

\section{Control Regions}
\label{SECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_ControlRegions}
%Status: DONE

The dominant backgrounds in this analysis come from W and Z decays, they are estimated by using independent data control regions which are extrapolated to the signal region with the help of \gls{MC} simulation. The \gls{QCD} multi-jet background is directly estimated from data. The remaining minor backgrounds coming from top, dibosons and Drell Yan, are taken directly from \gls{MC} simulation.

\subsection{Z background estimation}
\label{SECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_ControlRegions_ZBackground}

%Status: DONE

The contribution of the Z($\nu\nu$)+jets process in the signal region is estimated by selecting the visible decay Z$\rightarrow\mu\mu$. The extrapolation to the signal region takes into consideration the difference of cross sections of these processes. The control region criteria is the same as the one used for the signal region with the exception that the lepton veto is replaced by requiring that the only leptons in the event are a pair of \textit{tight muons} with an invariant mass, $M_{\mu\mu}$, compatible with a Z decay, $60<M_{\mu\mu}<120\,\GeV$. The events on the signal region are estimated using equation \ref{EQUATION:ParkedDataAnalysis_ZBackground}.

The ratio of cross sections $\sigma(Z\rightarrow\nu\nu)$/$\sigma(Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu)$ was determined to be $5.651\pm 0.023$ (syst) and the selection efficiencies for the signal and control regions are respectively $\epsilon_{S}^{ZMC}=(1.8\pm 0.1) \times 10^{-6}$ and $\epsilon_{C}^{ZMC}=(1.2\pm 0.1) \times 10^{-6}$. The number of observed events, by both the main and cross check analysis, in this data control region is $N_{C}^{Data}=18\pm 4.2$, and the number of events estimated from \gls{MC} simulation in this control region originating from other backgrounds is $N_{C}^{bkg}=0.2 \pm 0.1 \stat$. The estimated contribution from \gls{EWK} produced Z+jets is 21\%. 

Figure \ref{FIGURE:ParkedDataAnalysis_ZBackground_KeyDistributions} shows distributions of $\Delta\eta_{jj}$, $M_{jj}$, $\text{MET}_{sig}$ and \gls{MET}.

Within the statistics available, a good agreement between data and MC is observed. The final estimate of the $Z\rightarrow \nu\nu$ background is $N_{S}^{Z\rightarrow\nu\nu}= 158.1 \pm 37.8 \stat \pm 21.2 \syst$.

\subsection{W background estimation}
\label{SECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_ControlRegions_WBackground}

%Status: Writing

% Similarly, in the case of the W background, events in which a lepton
% is explicitly identified are used to compare the MC to data, and
% extract a normalisation factor. This factor is then used to
% normalise the events predicted by the MC in the signal region. The W
% control regions are defined by replacing the signal region's lepton
% veto with a requirement for exactly one lepton (tight electron or
% tight muon) or hadronic tau in order to enrich the sample in W
% events. The number of W events in the signal region is then taken to
% be:
% 
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
  \label{eq:ddmethod}
  N_{S}^{W}&=N_{S}^{W\,MC}\frac{N_{C}^{Data}-N_{C}^{bkg}}{N_{C}^{W\,MC}}=N_{S}^{W\,MC}\cdot \rm{SF},
  \end{split}
\end{align}
% 
% calculated separately for W decaying to each of e, $\mu$ (with $W\rightarrow\tau\nu\rightarrow e/\mu\nu\nu\nu$ included) and hadronic $\tau$. The number of
% events $N_{C}^{bkg}$ from the backgrounds to the W control regions
% come mainly from the top processes, and are estimated from MC.


% In the W$\rightarrow\tau_{\mathrm{h}}\nu$ control region, almost no
% events pass the \mindphiall selection. The criteria on \mindphiall is
% hence replaced by a criteria on the minimum azimuthal angle separation
% between the \MET and one of the leading two jets, \mindphileading, required
% to be greater than 1. To reject the background from multijet events,
% an additional requirement that the transverse mass of the W be greater
% than 20 GeV is used. By studying the W$\rightarrow\mu\nu$ region
% (which has enough events to observe the full range of the \mindphiall
% distribution), a 20\% systematic uncertainty is added to the
% W$\rightarrow\tau_{\mathrm{h}}\nu$ background estimate to cover the
% small discrepancy in shape of the \mindphiall variable observed
% between data and MC. Distributions of M$_{jj}$, \MET, and \mindphiall
% are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:wmjjcontplots},\,\ref{fig:wmetcontplots} and \ref{fig:wmindphicontplots}. Good agreement between data
% and MC is observed. The final estimates of the $W\rightarrow l\nu$
% backgrounds, together with the number of events selected in signal and
% control regions, are shown in Table \ref{tab:ZWTopRes}.

\subsection{Top background estimation}
\label{SECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_ControlRegions_TopBackground}

%Status: Writing

% Two top control regions have also been investigated. One (region 1) is
% driven by the selection of two leptons, either of different flavour (e$\mu$), or
% of the same flavour (ee or $\mu\mu$) with a veto on the Z mass region.
% This region is found to be composed almost entirely of \ttbar
% events. The other (region 2) is based on the selection of one lepton (e
% or $\mu$), and the requirement that one of the two leading jets is identified as a jet from a b quark
% (using the Combined Secondary Vertex algorithm ~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012jua}). This region is found to be composed of 10\%
% single top, 50\% \ttbar and 40\% W+jets. The number of events expected from simulation is found to be in good agreement with the
% observed number of events in both control regions. The data-to-simulation scale factors obtained are
% $1.21\pm 0.19$ (data stat.)$ \pm 0.16 $(syst.) from 21 events observed in region 1 and
% $0.88\pm 0.07$ (data stat.)$ \pm 0.08$ (syst.) from 429 events observed in region 2.
% The systematic uncertainty in these scale factors is dominated by the limited statistics in the simulation.
% Based on these results we assign a 20\% systematic uncertainty to the nominal prediction for the top quark contribution
% in the signal region.
% 
% %The grey shaded band in the signal region figure is the total
% %systematic and statistical uncertainty on the total background
% %estimation. It should be noted that the QCD contribution, estimated at
% %17 events across the distribution, is not shown.

\subsection{QCD background estimation}
\label{SECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_ControlRegions_QCDBackground}

%Status: Writing

% For the QCD background, a data-based method using events with non-isolated \MET is employed. Three
% regions are defined: (i) a region denoted as "inverted" that 
% gives a description of the QCD shape; (ii) a region denoted as "3-jet"
% where a cross-check of how well the QCD shape
% describes the data is performed; and (iii) a region denoted as "sideband" from which
% a normalisation of the QCD shape to be applied in
% the signal region is extracted.
% 
% The inverted region is selected by changing the requirement on
% \mindphiall to \mindphiall$<$1.0, and requiring \mindphileading $>$ 2.3, thus providing a region where the leading two jets are signal like, but the \MET is not isolated.
%  The distribution of \METsig is shown after this
% inverted selection in Fig.~\ref{fig:invqcd} (left). About 20\% of the
% events are expected to come from W, Z and top processes. The QCD
% shape is defined as the shape of the data in this region after subtracting the MC predictions for the non QCD processes which are normalised by the SF determined from the corresponding control regions selected in the same conditions as the inverted region. Good
% agreement is found between the data and the shape predicted by the VBF-enriched QCD MC simulation in this region as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:invqcd}
% (left).
% 
% To ensure that the QCD shape is adequate to describe the isolated \MET the 3-jet
% QCD-dominated control region is defined by requiring \mindphiall$>1$, \METsig$>3$ and at least three jets with p$_{T}>30$\,GeV.
% From simulation we expect a negligible contribution from signal after requiring a third jet in the event. The expected number of QCD events
% in the 3-jet region, n$_{QCD}^{3j}$, is then taken as the
% background-subtracted data, with the W and Z expectations being
% normalised to their respective leptonic control regions.  We then compare the QCD shape, taken from the inverted region with \mindphileading$>1.0$ and normalised to n$_{QCD}^{3j}$, with the data in this region. The distribution of \METsig is shown in this
% QCD-enriched selection in Fig.~\ref{fig:invqcd} (right). The discrepancy between data and prediction in this QCD-dominated 3-jet region is found to be less than 20\%. However, because most of the events passing
% the final selection have only two jets, this control region can not be
% used in the final QCD estimate.

% A sideband region is used
% to provide a  normalisation of the QCD shape to be used in the signal region. 
% The normalisation sideband is defined as those events in which 
% 3$<$\METsig$<$4 and 1.0$<$\mindphileading$<$2.0.
%  It is observed that the normalisation
% factor decreases rapidly as the requirements on \METsig and \mindphileading
% are tightened. To model this behaviour the normalisation factor is
% measured as a function of the requirement placed on \METsig and
% as a function of the requirement placed on \mindphileading. Both
% functional forms are then extrapolated to the signal region
% requirements. The average of the two extrapolations is used as the central prediction and the envelope is used to assign the systematic uncertainty on the QCD multijets normalisation.

\section{Systematics}

%Status: DONE

The dominant source of uncertainty is due to the statistical uncertainty associated with the yields of the control regions both in data and \gls{MC} simulation, which are used for the estimation of the different backgrounds in signal region. 

The errors associated to the jet energy scale, unclustered energy scale and jet energy resolution are estimated for both signal and background processes by varying each quantity independently by its uncertainties \cite{ARTICLE:CMSDeterminationJetEnergyCalibration}. For each variation the \gls{MET} is recomputed and the signal and backgrounds predictions are recalculated. A similar procedure is applied for the lepton efficiency and \gls{PU} scale factors which are applied to the \gls{MC} simulation, which are also varied by their uncertainties and propagated through the analysis \cite{ARTICLE:CMSMuonReconstruction7TeV,ARTICLE:CMSElectronReconstruction8TeV}.

The uncertainty associated with the integrated luminosity measurement is of 2.6\% and is only applied to the \gls{MC} simulated signal and backgrounds \cite{ARTICLE:CMSLuminosityBasedonPixelClusterCounting}. The main backgrounds are normalised using a data-driven method which takes into account the trigger efficiency, while the impact of the luminosity measurement in the signal and minor backgrounds was found to be negligible.

Uncertainties associated with diboson cross sections are taken from \gls{CMS} measurements \cite{ARTICLE:CMSMeasurmentOfWWandZZxsec}, while the theoretical uncertainties due to \gls{PDF} and \gls{QCD} scales associated to the signal cross section are taken from the \gls{LHC} Higgs Cross Section Working Groups Yellow Report 3 \cite{ARTICLE:HandbookofLHCHiggsCrossSectionsInclusiveObservables,ARTICLE:HandbookofLHCHiggsCrossSectionsDifferentialDistributions}.

% TODO: Ask patrick, ``compatible within statistical uncertainty`` of what?
The uncertainty of the extrapolation of the  $Z\rightarrow\nu\nu$ background obtained from the \gls{QCD} production of $Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ was estimated by comparing the prediction from \textsc{MADGRAPH} and a\textsc{MC@NLO\_MG5} \cite{ARTICLE:aMCatNLO}. The results from both generators were compatible within statistical uncertainty, leading to no additional uncertainties being added. 

Table \ref{TABLE:ParkedDataAnalysis_Systematics_Summary} shows a summary of the overall size of each uncertainty as a percentage of the total signal and background predictions.

\section{Limits on the cross section of invisibly decaying Higgs bosons}
\label{SECTION:ParkedDataAnalysis_Limits}

%Status: DONE

As shown in table \ref{TABLE:PromptDataAnalysis_BackgroundEstimation_BackgroundSummary}, 508 data events were observed in the signal region, this yield is compatible with the background only prediction. Since no evidence of signal is observed 95\% \gls{CL} upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction are computed. The limits are calculated using the asymptotic $\mathrm{CL}_\mathrm{s}$ method \cite{ARTICLE:CLsTechnique,ARTICLE:CLCompForCombiningSearchesWithSmallStat,ARTICLE:HandbookofLHCHiggsCrossSectionsDifferentialDistributions} based on asymptotic formulae \cite{ARTICLE:AsymptoticCLS}, following the standard \gls{CMS} Higgs boson searches combination technique \cite{ARTICLE:CMS_HiggsDiscovery,ARTICLE:HiggsCombination}. Systematic uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters and treated according to the frequentist paradigm \cite{ARTICLE:HiggsCombination} and all correlations between processes are taken into account.

If \gls{SM} production cross sections and acceptances are assumed, the observed (expected) 95\% C.L. limit on \BRinv of a \gls{SM} $125\,\GeV$ Higgs boson is 57\% (40\%). Figure \ref{FIGURE:ParkedDataAnalysis_Limits_VBFLimit} shows the the 95\% C.L. limit on \BRinv and the 95\% C.L. limit on the cross section times \BRinv, both under the assumption of \gls{SM} Higgs boson acceptances as a function of Higgs mass. .

AS it can be observed in table \ref{TABLE:ParkedDataAnalysis_Systematics_Summary}, similarly to the \textit{prompt analysis} the dominant source of systematic uncertainty is the limited number of events present in the control regions both in data and \gls{MC} simulation. This effect is particularly noticeable in the Z control region, if this region statistical uncertainty was of the order of the one measured in the $W\rightarrow\mu\nu$ control region the expected 95\% C.L. limit on the cross section times \BRinv for a \gls{SM} 125 GeV Higgs boson would be reduced to 33\%.

%TODO: Should I write the combined stuff???
% The result is also combined with that obtained by CMS in searches in the channel where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z which was reported in ~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014tja}. The procedure for this combination is also described in ~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014tja}. The 95\% C.L. observed (expected) limit on \BRinv\, after combination is 47\% (35\%) for a SM 125 GeV Higgs boson.

% \section{Results}
% \label{sec:results}
% The final number of events for each process that passes the selection
% is estimated using the MC in the case of the W, Z and top background
% processes, or the non-isolated \MET events for the QCD multijets
% process, with the normalisation obtained from the control regions, and
% is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:bgSummary}.  The distributions of the
% $\Delta\eta_{jj}$, M$_{jj}$, \METsig and \MET variables, after full selection, are
% shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sigplots}. An overview of all considered systematic
% uncertainties is given in Table~\ref{tab:syst-qqH}, with the effect on
% the sum of all the background processes and the signal with
% $\mH=125$\GeV and $\BRinv=100$\% given separately.

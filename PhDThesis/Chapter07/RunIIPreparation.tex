\section{Run II QCD Monte Carlo samples}
\label{SECTION:RunIIQCDMonteCarloSamples}

Simulating and reconstructing quantities of \gls{QCD} events comparable to the ones produced at the \gls{LHC} experiments is impractical. At every second of \gls{LHC} physics operation several millions of bunch crossings happen, each one able to provoke several simultaneous collisions. With the currently available hardware it takes in excess of one minute to fully simulate one of such bunch crossings. 


This constraints lead to \gls{QCD} events being simulated in $p_\perp$ hats, where the first collision is generated within range where the outgoing particles summed $p_\perp$ is in a predefined range. Then several other collisions are added to the event as \gls{PU}. This additional collisions are generated without any constraints in $p_\perp$. 

This bin method allows the user to have samples with increasing energy and study the influence of each of them in their own analysis. As a practical example we do not need to look over millions of \gls{QCD} events, most of them with only low energy particles, to find high energy jets. We can just start from the higher \gls{QCD} $p_\perp$ hats add lower ones until the stop contributing to our selection. On the other hand, there are some analysis that require jets and/or \gls{MET} with very low values where inclusive \gls{QCD} samples will not have enough statistics to provide insight into the \gls{QCD} behaviour. The \gls{CMS} \gls{VBF} Higgs to invisible analysis is one of them.

During the preparation of the Run I \gls{VBF} Higgs to invisible analysis a set of \gls{QCD} samples with \gls{VBF} like jets and real \gls{MET} was generated. This samples allowed to understand the mechanisms that create real \gls{MET} in \gls{QCD} and how those could be mitigated.

Our analysis is now preparing for Run II it was considered once again to be useful to have similar samples remade and possibly extended. It was identified that not only real \gls{MET} is significant but also fake \gls{MET} coming from detector miss-measurement. If such a sample could be produced and simulate such effects would be of great interest, allowing the analysis to possibly evolve to a shape based analysis or event to use machine learning techniques.

This study investigates the alternatives and attempts to quantify the costs of of producing such samples.

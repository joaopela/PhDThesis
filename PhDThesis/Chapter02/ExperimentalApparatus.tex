The \gls{LHC} \cite{ARTICLE:LHC Machine} is currently the world's largest particle accelerator and is capable to produce the highest energy particle beam ever made by mankind. This gigantic machine with a total perimeter of 27 kilometer was built at \gls{CERN} in a circular tunnel at an average depth of 100 meters below ground under the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland. I Diagram of the LHC tunnel can be found in figure \ref{FIGURE:ExperimentalApparatus_LHCLayoutUnderground}.

The \gls{LHC} is a synchrotron machine with the capability to accelerate particles in two separated beam pipes with travel in opposite direction. These beams only cross and are allowed to collide in four specific points of the accelerator where huge particle detectors are installed to detect the products of such collisions. This experiments are name ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE.

The \gls{LHC} is only the last element of a complex accelerator chain which step by step increases the energy of the particles. A simplified diagram of the \gls{CERN} accelerator chain can be found in figure \ref{FIGURE:ExperimentalApparatus_LHCAccelaratorChain}.

%
% The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is at this moment the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator
% in activity. I was built in a 27 kilometer circular tunnel, at a average depth of around 100 meters under the
% Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland.
% 
% The LHC a synchrotron machine designed to collide two opposing particle beams of protons each one with a 
% maximum energy of 7 TeV per proton and for lead nuclei beams a maximum of 574 TeV per nucleus. Providing a 
% maximum available energy of 14 TeV in the center of mass frame for a single proton-proton.
% 
% To be able to accelerate protons (and ions) to such high energies the LHC relies on a chain of other accelerator
% machines (fig. \ref{ExperimentalApparatus_LHCAccelaratorChain}). For protons, it all starts at the Linear 
% Particle Accelerator 2 (LINAC2) which get protons to 50 MeV, they are injected into the Proton Synchrotron
% Booster (PSB) which further accelerates them to 26 GeV. After getting to this energy, protons go into the Super 
% Proton Synchrotron (SPS) where the get accelerated to 450 GeV. When maximum energy at SPS is reached protons
% can get injected into the LHC in bunches, where they finally get accelerated to the maximum energy of 7 TeV. 
% A single fill of proton bunches can be circulated and collided maintaining rates of collisions from 10 to 24 hours.

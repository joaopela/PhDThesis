\section{Standard Model of Particle Physics}

% Status: DONE

The \gls{SM} of particle physics is a quantum field theory that describes the electromagnetic, weak nuclear and strong forces and their interaction with matter. This theory is one of the most successful theories ever made and was able to describe data from a wide range of experimental measurements. Before its discovery in 2012 \cite{ARTICLE:ATLAS_HiggsDiscovery,ARTICLE:CMS_HiggsDiscovery} the Higgs boson was the only missing particle that was predicted by this theory and not yet found. 

Although its success, the \gls{SM} does not explain some phenomena observed in nature, like the presence of large quantity of \textit{dark matter} in the universe, or the even more mysterious \textit{dark energy}. The discovery of the Higgs boson could allow to probe the production of dark matter directly, through its decay into these elusive particles. This chapter briefly describes the theory behind the \gls{SM}, the Higgs mechanism, how to search for Higgs invisible decays.

\begin{declaration}
I declare that the work contained in this thesis is my own, and all results and figures taken from other sources are indicated in the text and referenced appropriately. The analyses presented in this thesis were developed in close collaboration with other members of the CMS experiment.

For the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) Higgs to invisible prompt analysis I have contributed with the literature review and final background cross section input values for background normalization. QCD multi-jet background studies were also preformed with the target of improving the final selection or prepare the parked analysis, this analysis is presented to give context for the more important work developed later. 

For the VBF Higgs to invisible parked analysis I have participated in the development of the parked trigger, which was used to record the majority of the analysed data. I have continued the QCD multi-jet background studies which have lead to the production of dedicated Monte Carlo simulations and novel approaches to reject this type of events. I have been the responsible for the cross check analysis of the main result which has successfully validated the implementation of the main analysis \cite{ARTICLE:CMSVBFHiggsInvisibleParkedAnalysisPAS}. It is a normal a requirement for many \gls{CMS} publications to have a cross check analysis implemented independently from the main result in order to be able to ensure the accuracy of the final results. I have also participated in the preparation of the Run II analysis where I have lead the development of both the triggers used for data recording during 2015. Additionally, I have developed a method to create the first QCD multi-jet Monte Carlo sample with no MET requirements with signal like properties.

As part of the CMS Level 1 Trigger (L1T) Detector Performance Group (DPG) I have developed monitoring tools for this system, which were both used for real-time monitoring and posterior data certification for physics analysis usage. My work in this group has lead to my appointment for two years to the position of coordinator of the \gls{CMS} \gls{L1T} Data quality Monitoring software development team. Field work was also performed by doing shifts as Trigger and Shift Leader in the experiment control room and on call shifts as the Trigger Detector on Call (DOC) expert.

\maketitle

The thesis will focus both on my service work developing the monitoring for the Level-1 Trigger of the experiment and also on the Higgs to Invisible search in the VBF channel using the CMS detector at the LHC. My funding ends on the 31st of December of 2015 and this is also the 4 year deadline set  by the college for delivering a thesis.

The Higgs analysis work encompasses the preparation of triggers for run I, the contribution to the analyses using Prompt and Parked run I data and preparations for run II.

The work yet to be finished includes obtaining Monte Carlo results for the Run I parked analysis cross check, finishing the tuning of the run II trigger and making a final proposal for new Monte Carlo QCD samples with VBF characteristics. 

The total length of the thesis is intended to be in the range of 100-150.
